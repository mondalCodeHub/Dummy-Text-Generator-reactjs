# About this project
```REACT-SERIES-PROJECT-05(2022)```

We sometimes need to test with text while working on a project, and for that we need some kind of dummy text that has no meaning. We can get as much dummy text as we want using this web app.



# Purpose of this project
This project is part of my React learning process from the scratch. This is a very simple project to help me brush up on my skills and prerequisite knowledge before diving into a large real-world application. The complexity of the react projects in this repository will grow as the days pass.
